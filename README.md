# Concept Graph
This is a node based, procedural content creation tool.
You have a collection of nodes that you connect together to create a complex result. You can see it as a form
of visual scripting, but for 3D models generation.

## Overview

The graph node can be as simple ...

... or as complicated as you want ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52043844/82753149-d0791080-9dc3-11ea-8b76-035d7115ee55.png)

## Status

This tool is still a **work in progress**. Until it hits version 1.0, it is not
considered production ready and there's no guarantees the files generated with
this addon will be compatible with later versions.

### Important note

This tool started as a Godot Engine addon but is currently been transitionned to be a standalone software.

This means you will no longer need to use this from the Godot editor, but simply download and use ConceptGraph as any other tool.
The current release is a preview version. I expect bugs and regressions as it was not fully tested on all target platforms. OSX versions are
known to be troublesome.


## Quick start

[Check out the wiki](https://github.com/HungryProton/concept_graph/wiki) for detailed explanations


## Known issues and roadmap

+ For a list of known issues, [head over the issue tracker](https://github.com/HungryProton/concept_graph/issues)
+ To track the work in progress and planned feature, [head over the project board](https://github.com/HungryProton/concept_graph/projects)

The **current focus** is to get the standalone version in a working state and **add a lot of documentation**.
Even though ConceptGraph doesn't have all of its planned features, we can't expect anyone to actually use this tool if nobody knows how to.

## Build from source
